  <!-- Main Content -->
  <div class="container" id="main-body">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <center><p>"What? Maine doesn't have parole?"</p></center> 
        <p> With only 16 states not embracing parole practices, parole systems often are taken granted as part and parcel with criminal justice.</p>
        <p>Even many Maine natives, do not know that the state did away with parole 46 years ago.</p>
        <p>Corrections systems are stretched so thin by the burden placed on them from the judicial reforms that Maine initiated in 1976, that the minimum of care is sometimes beyond their ability to offer offenders who are committed to their custody.</p>
        <P>Prisons have become our new emergency rooms, where triage dictates which problems are prioritized and attended to, and which are marginalized. Prisons, like emergency rooms, may treat urgent situations, but cannot provide chronic care.</p>
        <p>An incarcerated person is only eligible for transfer to a minimum-security facility within 5 years of their release. Readjusting to contact with communities for volunteering/work release does not begin until they are within 2 years of release; this is the same timeframe they qualify to apply for Supervised Community Confinement. If a resident of a corrections center is not eligible for transfer and releases from a higher security facility, their release planning does not begin until the last 9 months of their sentence.</p>
        <p>95% of all incarcerated people will be released eventually. Whether they behave or not, care or don’t, learn or stay in their ways. Most incarcerated people will return to the world. These possibilities present questions of quality versus quantity. Without a proper standard for exactly how one returns to the world, there is no hope to rise above the adversity of a hard life, a poor choice, or bitter regret. If everyone wins the same prize at different times in this waiting game, it is the crowd of onlookers who stand to lose.</p>
        <p>By reinstating parole in Maine, we challenge offenders, corrections institutions, and the community to raise their standards. Parole provides a steppingstone to earn passage on the road to redemption; this is a way for an offender to become an ex-offender, one who has rehabilitated themselves and wants to offer a better person to the world.</p>
        <p>With proper oversight and implementation of discretionary parole, we assign the responsibility of proof to the offender. Why are you here? What have you done with your time? Who are you now? What have you learned? And what will you do with a second chance? Our society is far safer receiving someone who’s corrections experience was a plotted course from the moment they came through the gate.</p>
        <p>If we plan for reentry the moment we incarcerate a member of our community, it is not their choice to do better or not, it becomes their mission to find their way back after going astray.</p>
